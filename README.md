# Agora managment Site

A managment site where users can create projects, comment on projects and mark them as completed (delete them). Includes a dashboard with filters and IPFS profile photos.

## Stack

The front-end is written with React.js, using libraries like react-dom, Router, date-fns, and many more. In addition, I use Pinata API to store the profile photos. The back-end is handled in Firebase, with Firestore database.

## A demo is on its way

I'm working on making available a demo where anyone can use the page as a real user.
